# Chat App Project
This project is a real-time chat application built using React.js, TailwindCSS, and Firebase. The main goal of the project is to learn Firebase and develop a chat app that allows users to interact with each other in different rooms.

## Features
* Login Page: Users can log in using their Google Gmail account via Firebase Authentication.
* Room Page: After successful login, users are redirected to the Room page where they can input the name of a chat room to join. Each room has its own chat space.
* Chat Page: Messages sent by users are displayed in real-time using Firebase. Users can send and read messages instantly.
* Emoji Picker: Integrated with the react-emoji-picker library, users can add emojis to their messages.
* Message Scrolling: When reading older messages, a scroll-down button appears, which can be clicked to jump to the most recent message.
* Random Username Color: Each user is assigned a random color for their username, making it easy to differentiate between users.
* Firebase Integration: All user data, chat messages, and room information are stored in Firebase for real-time synchronization.

## Technologies Used
* React.js for building the frontend user interface.
* TailwindCSS for styling the app with utility-first CSS.
* Firebase for user authentication and real-time database.
* React Emoji Picker for adding emojis to messages.
